<p style="color:#202520; margin-left:150px; margin-right: 150px">Dr. Sinha is a professor in the department of Plant Biology at UC Davis whose research is in plant evolutionary developmental biology. Her early work examined the genes controlling leaf development, and she demonstrated that the KNOTTED-1 homeobox (knox1) gene regulates leaf formation in maize. Building on that work, she showed that knox genes are involved in determining leaf shape, and she uncovered additional genes involved in leaf development. She has also carried out research on the molecular genetics of plant parasites. She was elected to be a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2005 and the American Society of Plant Biologists in 2018. <a href =  "http://sinhalab.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style = "text-decoration: none">[Read more]</a></p>

<p style="color:#202520; margin-left:150px; margin-right: 150px">As a senior imaging data analyst at Corteva Agriscience since June 2020, Kyle collaborates with field scientists, project leaders, and data scientists to create and evaluate imaging phenotyping assays for crop protection evaluations. The main challenges in his position comes with scale: throughput, cost, and people. He leverages tools such as the NVIDIA ecosystem, Boston Dynamics Spot robot in Woodland, and cameras at different spatial scales. Kyle is a proud Aggie, graduating with his B.S. (2018) and M.S. (2020) in Biological Systems Engineering here at UC Davis. He worked in the Digital Agriculture Lab with Dr. Alireza Pourreza evaluating drought stress in turfgrass and predicting almond yield using sUAS platforms. <a href =  "https://kylehcheung.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style = "text-decoration: none">[Read more]</a></p>
